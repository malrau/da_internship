===============================

This repository hosts the project for the internship of the Data Analysis degree of the University of Messina. The project, in short, aims at the creation of C++ classes storing ADT (notably graphs) that reproduce traversable topologies and the methods to be used to efficiently traverse them.

This is still an early draft readme file.
